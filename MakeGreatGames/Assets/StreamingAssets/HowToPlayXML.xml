  <Page Name="Special Abilities" Text="To help you achieve your ultimate victory against the enemy tanks, you may collect coins and spend them to generate a random special ability, which may then be used for some time afterwards. Beware, however, as the enemy tanks collect and use these coins too!" Image="None"/>
